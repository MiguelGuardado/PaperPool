# PaperPool
This program is meant as a supplement for a mathematical proofs class at San Francisco State University. This program was made to help run simulations and get results to help enrich the concepts and proofs we were learning from this game. I used python to help run this program and used matplotlib to help utilize the data visualization.

Suppose you are playing a game of pool that always have 4 corners and can span the size of nxn. You always start each game in the bottom left corner A, you hit the ball at a 45 degree angle in a frictionless environment. The ball will keep going straight unless it either: hits the pocket in the top left corner(D), top right corner(c), bottom left corner(B), or it hits a side causing it to reflect 45 degrees until it hits a pocket. I made this program to run many simulations depending on the size of n that the user will give us. If you ask for the dimension to be 10 you will get a bar graph of 100 results showing you for each row and column, a number for how many times the ball bounced and reflected and have a color to represent which pocket the ball lands in.
